# Snapshot.io

## A fully functional MERN stack application that allows you to capture cities in real time

Around the time this project was created, New York City dealt with heavy air contamination caused by the Canadian Wildfires. The Breaking Bad Mexico filter that plagued the city at the time made it difficult for people in the city to go outside, even for a split second.
This app was created to allow users to plan ahead to go outside. This is very useful for people with health conditions such as asthma, which one of the project creators has. 

* Allows users to access News and Weather Information with a single search
* Information retrieved and aggregated from the NewsAPI and OpenMeteoAPI
* Retrieved stored on MongoDB for faster retrieval times
* Timely updates to enable the user to recieve the most up-to-date news and weather information

## How to use

Using Snapshot is very simple, just search up whatever city you want to capture it in real time. The world is your oyster.

## How to contribute

Download the project and add the environment variables to both the backend and frontend folders (.env in the back and .env.local in the front). Run npm install inside both folders to download all dependecies. Run nodemon app.js on the backend and npm start on the frontend.
For database access, you can either create your own mongodb database and plug in your connection URI or you can manipulate the project files so you can use your database of choice. You can also contact one of the main contributors if you would like to be added to the mongodb project connected to the deployed site.

## Future Ideas

We plan to integrate OpenAI for feedback on current events and weather patterns. We also plan to allow for user registration and search history features to allow for a more seamless user experience.
